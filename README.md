# bypass-length-sar
This repository holds the data and R code used in analyses to support Faulkner et al. (2019) and Faulkner et al. (2020).

## Data
There are two data sets used for the analyses on bypass probabilities and there are four data sets used for the analyses on smolt-to-adult returns (SAR).  These data were also used in the formal Response to Comment on the paper.

## R Code
There are two separate scripts for the analyses of bypass probability: one for Chinook and one for steelhead. Likewise, there are two separate scripts for the SAR analyses by species.  There are two scripts for the power analyses used in the Response to Comment: one for Chinook and one for Steelhead.
