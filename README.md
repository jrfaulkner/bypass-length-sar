# bypass-length-sar
This repository holds the data and R code used in analyses to support Faulkner et al. (2019).

## Data
There are two data sets used for the analyses on bypass probabilities and there are four data sets used for the analyses on smolt-to-adult returns (SAR).

## R Code
There are two separate scripts for the analyses of bypass probability, one for Chinook and one for steelhead. Likewise, there are two separate scripts for the SAR analyses by species.
